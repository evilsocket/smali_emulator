# Smali Emulator

This software will emulate a [**smali**](https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali) source file generated by apktool, it is intended to be used as a quick and dirty way to defeat various types of encryption and obfuscation while reversing an APK.

You'll find some examples in the `examples` folder of this project.

[Explanation of the "why" and "how" can be found here.](https://www.evilsocket.net/2016/04/18/how-i-defeated-an-obfuscated-and-anti-tamper-apk-with-some-python-and-a-home-made-smali-emulator/)

#### Note

This is highly experimental, a very small subset of the Dalvik opcodes is currently supported, see the `smali/opcodes.py` file for more details.
